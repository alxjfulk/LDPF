The code corresponding to the manuscript "Exploring the effects of prescribed fire on ticks spread and propagation in a spatial setting"
To run the files, download MMPDE lab from Dr. Weizhang Huang's website (https://whuang.ku.edu/MMPDElab/mmpdelabv1.html) and move the files from scenario 1, 2, or 3 folders (inside the examples folder) to the examples folder and open them in matlab. We ran our simulations with 50 divisions in the x and y direction (jmax = 50,kmax = 50)
